\section{Proposed System Overview}%
\label{sec:system_overview}
To demonstrate the efficacy of a source synchronous system we propose a single
pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) source that optically transmits over two
channels to a single receiver. If transmission is alternated the effect is that
the receiver would receiver bursts of data from two different channels. If the
full PRBS sequence is received then the system would be working correctly.\\ An
overview of the system is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:overview}.

\section{Objectives}%
\label{sec:objectives}
The overall objective is to develop a successful burst source-synchronous
communication system for comparison with a system that uses a CDR.
\noindent
Overall we can break down the project to the following sub-objectives: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Burst mode PRBS transmission over two channels alongside clock
    \item Optical transmission over two channels, then muxing the two channels together
    \item Source-synchronous reception of PRBS data 
\end{itemize}
