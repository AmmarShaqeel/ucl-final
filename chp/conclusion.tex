\chapter{Conclusion}
In this project, we aimed to achieve a fully working burst-mode
source-synchronous optical transmission. 

We developed a wrapper for a PRBS generator that enabled burst mode
transmission and were able to successfully demonstrate this in simulation.
We also developed hardware mounts for the SOAs. We were not able to test optical
transmission as the labs were closed. 

On the receiver side we developed a burst-mode receiver which worked in simulation, but
had issues when tested in the full system, that we did not have time to troubleshoot. 
Given more time it is possible that these issues could have been resolved.  

With regards to running the receiver source-synchronously we were not able to
bypass the CDR.  We attempted a workaround, but were hindered due to
a lack of publically available information about certain aspects of the
transceiver. It is possible that if a different board was used, or a different
type of transmitter, that this could have been accomplished. 

Overall we were able to progress towards a workable prototype, even though we
were not fully able to accomplish the stated goal.
